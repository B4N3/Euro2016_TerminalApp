PS: to navigate through the different menus within the app, it is not case sensitive:
"What team do you want to see the stats for? 'ALL' 'GROUP' 'TEAM'       
  1. you can search by group, team or see a list of all of the teams
  2. You can type: 'all' or 'ALL', 'group' or 'GROUP' -> either will work for every menu

This is my first time writing a program as such, if you have any tips on how I can improve it or have any questions, shoot me a message!
