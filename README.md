[Documentation and code examples for this project](http://bit.ly/2jdn8sF)

FootyLinks is a Python/Flask web app that I created for fun hosted on Heroku which helps you find:

* Live football games scores & details
* Links for any live match streams
* Match highlights
* All kinds of stats


No logins or emails required, and there will **never** be Ads. 

This is purely for fixing those football cravings without the headache of clicking through multiple websites.ðŸ˜€
